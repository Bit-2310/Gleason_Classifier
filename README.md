## Dataset
The dataset contains **200 tissue microarray (TMA) images**, divided into training, validation, and testing sets in a **70:15:15** ratio. The images are categorized into the following classes:
- **Benign**
- **Gleason3**
- **Gleason4**
- **Gleason5**

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**
   - The dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Images were resized, normalized, and augmented to improve model performance.

2. **Model Training**
   - Models were trained using the PyTorch framework.
   - Techniques like dropout and learning rate scheduling were used to prevent overfitting and optimize performance.

3. **Visualization**
   - Grad-CAM was used to visualize the areas of tissue influencing the modelâ€™s predictions.

## Models
The repository includes the following saved PyTorch models:

1. **EfficientNet**:
   - Location: `models/efficientnet_best.pth`
   - Description: Trained EfficientNet model with a test accuracy of 62%.

2. **ResNet-50**:
   - Location: `models/resnet_best.pth`
   - Description: Trained ResNet-50 model with a test accuracy of 97%.

You can load these models for inference or further fine-tuning using the code below:

```python
import torch
from efficientnet_pytorch import EfficientNet
from torchvision.models import resnet50

# Load ResNet-50
resnet_model = resnet50(pretrained=False)
resnet_model.load_state_dict(torch.load("models/resnet_best.pth"))
resnet_model.eval()

# Load EfficientNet
efficientnet_model = EfficientNet.from_name("efficientnet-b0")
efficientnet_model.load_state_dict(torch.load("models/efficientnet_best.pth"))
efficientnet_model.eval()
```

## Results
- **ResNet-50** achieved a test accuracy of **97%**, making it a reliable choice for classification.
- **EfficientNet** achieved a test accuracy of **62%**, with potential for improvement.
- Grad-CAM visualizations effectively highlighted tumor regions in tissue samples.

## Future Work
- Expand the dataset to improve model generalization.
- Experiment with other CNN architectures like **DenseNet**.
- Develop ensemble models to boost overall performance.
